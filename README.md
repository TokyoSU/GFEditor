This project only have the item editor, but later on, i'm planning to do every files like S_DropItem or S_Monster and have a full editor (except map editor/maker).
Only compatible with 076 because of how the ini files are done (and the structure of the project).
### Take in account this tool is still wip and there could be some bug !
